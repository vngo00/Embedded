This readme file will be the main note for now and I will try to think of other
approaches to help make note taking and putting learned information in a more organized structure for better learning.

1. Install the STM32 IDE for development and projects (st.com)
https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/stm32cubeide.html

2.Recommended documents to get:
-
    User Mannual (In my case UM1724)
    Reference manual (RM0383)
    DataSheet
