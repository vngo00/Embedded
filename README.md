# Embedded

To get started on the journey to learning embedded, I will follow the tutorials on the Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming Ground Up TM (STM32) course from Udemy to help jump start the learning process.

based on this course, I will also suse the Nucleo-F411RE discovery board.

Will try and absorb as much as possible.
